##CSS only slide down panel

I was looking for an unobtrusive way to add share links to my examples e.g., Fiddles, Dabblets, etc. and this is what I came up with. I'm using it for share links, but it can also be used to create something like this: http://web-kreation.com/demos/Sliding_login_panel_jquery/

My example pushes the main content down, for effect. You can, just as easily, have the slider overlay the main content by removing one line of css and adding a z-index to the slider. 

Known issues: 

1. Using unicode fonts isn't really the best, due to different browser's renderings. I'd suggest an icon font.
