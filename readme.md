##CSS only slide down panel

Example: http://genelocklin.github.com/css-only-slide-down-panel/

Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/genelocklin/tEjs9/

I was looking for an unobtrusive way to add share links to my examples e.g., Fiddles, Dabblets, etc. and this is what I came up with. 

I'm using it for share links, but it can also be used to create something like this: http://web-kreation.com/demos/Sliding_login_panel_jquery/

Make sure that you change the share links to match the page you're sharing.
