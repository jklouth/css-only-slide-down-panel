##CSS only slide down panel

I was looking for an unobtrusive way to add share links to my examples e.g., Fiddles, Dabblets, etc. and this is what I came up with. I'm using it for share links, but it can also be used to create something like this: http://web-kreation.com/demos/Sliding_login_panel_jquery/

My example pushes the content down, for effect. You can, just as easily, have the slider overlay the content by removing one line of css and adding a z-index to the slider. 

Known issues: There's an iPhone issue with the content being pushed down. Works fine on iPad, so it's probably my code. Using unicode fonts isn't really the best, due to different browser's renderings. I'd suggest an icon font.
